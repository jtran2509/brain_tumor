# Brain Tumor Classifier
## About the Project
- A brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among childer and adults. With manual examination, it can be error-prone due to the level of complexities. Hence, the addition of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI) has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification.
- Since the dataset at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) only contains more than 3k of MRI, we will download another dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alaminbhuyan/mri-image-data)
- These 2 datasets contain over a total of 10,000 brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: no tumor, glioma, meningioma and pituitary
- **Goal**: Create a machine learning model that capable of classifying correct brain tumor with an aim of accuracy over 93%
  
## Built With
[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

[Numpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)

[Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANDAS)
[Resnet34](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet34.html)

## Usage
- The website/app is intended to classify MRI brain tumor into 4 clasess: no tumor, glioma, meningioma and pituitary.
- This website/app should be used as an add-on and shouldn't be considered as professional diagnosis. The main advantage is to give a second opinion
